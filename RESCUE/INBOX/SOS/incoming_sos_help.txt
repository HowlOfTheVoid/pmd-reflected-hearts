This folder contains SOS mail you've received from friends. If you cannot receive their SOS mail by connecting to their game online, they can send you their SOS file manually. Place their SOS mail in this folder, and you will be able to start a rescue mission as though you received it online. Once a rescue is completed, the file will be removed from this folder and a corresponding AOK mail will appear in the RESCUE/OUT/AOK/ folder. It is safe to change the name of these files as they will still be read properly by the game. You can also delete unneeded SOS mail by speaking to the Pelipper in Base Town or through the Roguelocke menu.
