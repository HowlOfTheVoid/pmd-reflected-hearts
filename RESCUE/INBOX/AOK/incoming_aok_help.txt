This folder is meant to hold AOK mail sent by friends who have completed the rescue mission you sent them. If you cannot receive their AOK mail by connecting to their game online, they can send you their AOK file manually. Place their AOK mail in this folder and check the status of your rescue in the game. The AOK file will be automatically used and you will be able to resume your adventure. It is safe to change the name of files here as they will still be read properly by the game.
