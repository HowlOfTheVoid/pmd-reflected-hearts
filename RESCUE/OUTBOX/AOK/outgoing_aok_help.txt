Files containing AOK mail will appear here whenever you complete a rescue mission. If you cannot send AOK mail directly by connecting to a friend online, you can send them the AOK file from this folder. Have them place your AOK file in their RESCUE/INBOX/AOK/ folder. They will be able to resume their adventure from the main menu. Once they resume their adventure, you'll have no need for the AOK mail and can delete it. You can also delete unneeded AOK mail by speaking to the Pelipper in Base Town or through the Roguelocke menu. It is safe to change the name of files in this folder as they will still be read properly by the game.
