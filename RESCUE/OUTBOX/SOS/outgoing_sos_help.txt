Files containing SOS mail will appear here whenever you choose to get help with a rescue. If you cannot send SOS mail directly by connecting to a friend online, you can send the SOS file in this folder. Have them place your SOS file in their RESCUE/INBOX/SOS/ folder. They will then be able to start a rescue mission as though they had received it online. It is safe to change the name of these files as they will still be read properly by the game. If you have accidentally deleted an SOS file here, simply view the SOS request within the game.
